This repository is made for people who want to use Notion as a standalone app on linux without any other additional bullshit. 
All it is, is really just wrapping https://notion.so inside an electron wrapper.
The code is 15 lines. That's all there is to it.

Build it yourself 
```npm run build```

Installation: Go to /dist
```sudo dpkg -i <built_package_name>.deb```

It's just configured to build to .deb as of this commit.

Cheers, Inu
